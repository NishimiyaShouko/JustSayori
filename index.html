"And the rainclouds are finally gone, finally i can be happy, with you",
"I love you MC, you're the one that always supported me when i needed the most",
"Thank you for helping me, i'll you never let you go <3",
"   ",
"You know, depression is a subject that on most of the times is ignored",
"Even tho it's such a serious disease",
"I always hided that i was depressed from you",
"Because it's so hard to speak up, you don't want people wasting their time on you",
"But at the same time, it hurts so much feeling alone, because you dragged everybody away from you",
"And you're so scared, you suffer so much, everything is gray and tasteless",
"Your feelings are a complete mess, and all you want is to disappear",
"I thought so many times in killing myself, but people like you and Natsuki made me rethink",
"But i'll confess, when i decided to commit suicide, when i was there with the rope in my neck",
"When i jumped from the chair, everything came like a storm, all the hope to have a happy life",
"All the love that i felt for you, all of the good moments, it made me rethink and it made me regret",
"But it was too late"
